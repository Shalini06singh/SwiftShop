## Installation

Clone Repository: Begin by cloning the repository containing the frontend codebase from the version control system.

Navigate to Project Directory: Move into the project directory where the codebase is cloned.

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies using a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) 

npm install

Setup Postman Collection: Import the provided Postman collection into your Postman application. This collection contains pre-defined API endpoints for the product list and detail features


Configure Backend: Ensure that the backend API is running and properly configured to handle requests for product data. Update any necessary configuration files or environment variables to point to the correct backend URL.


Start Development Server: Start the development server to run the frontend application locally.

npm start

Access Application: Once the development server is running, access the application through a web browser by navigating to the specified URL (usually http://localhost:3000)


Testing: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that the product list, detail pages, and variant switching functionalities are working as expected.

## Tools and Techniques

.Postman: Postman is used for testing and integrating APIs. The provided Postman collection contains pre-defined API endpoints for both product list and detail features.

.Frontend Framework: Utilize a frontend framework such as React to develop the user interfaces for the product list and detail pages.

.Backend API: The backend API is responsible for serving product data to the frontend. Ensure that the backend is properly configured to handle requests for product list and detail information.

.UI Design Tools: Use UI design tools to design and prototype the UI components for the product list and detail pages.


## Tech Stack


1.React.js: Frontend JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

2.JavaScript: Programming language used for both frontend and backend development.

3.Bootstrap: CSS framework for designing responsive and visually appealing web pages.
